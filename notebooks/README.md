# Notebooks Directory

## Original Implementation Steps

This directory contains the original CNN-LSTM implementation divided into steps:

1. **step1_data_exploration.py**: Google Drive connection and data exploration
2. **step2_data_loading.py**: Data loading and merging 
3. **step3_sequence_creation.py**: Sequence creation for CNN-LSTM
4. **step4_model_creation.py**: CNN-LSTM model architecture
5. **step5_model_training.py**: Model training process
6. **step6_model_evaluation.py**: Model evaluation and metrics
7. **step7_visualization.py**: Results visualization and reporting

## Main Notebook

- **BIST100_CNN_LSTM_Complete.py**: Complete implementation combining all steps

## Usage

Run the notebooks in order (step1 through step7) or use the complete implementation.

Note: These codes require Google Colab environment with Drive access.
